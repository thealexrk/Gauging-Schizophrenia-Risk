NB: This project is inspired by the following paper, the authors of which I owe a debt of gratitude for providing the code and data files I used:

> Prashanth Rajarajan, Tyler Borrman, Will Liao, et al. (2018). Neuron-specific signatures in the chromosomal connectome associated with schizophrenia risk. Science.

This endeavor simply represents an attempt to accelerate my own understanding of Connectomics.
